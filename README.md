# scraper-marcanet
scraping the web for public mexican brand information

# Objective

This script was hastily written to repeatedly query a government website for information regarding registered brands and identify whether or not they had expired.  If contact information was given, it would be used to sell brand registration services.

# Dependencies

It ran with phantomjs and requires jquery 3.2.1 

# Important Note

Since its use, the website has been under reconstruction and this program may no longer work.
